# Cloudinary's Android Demo Application

This Cloudinary Demo app was built to showcase and demonstrate the usage of the Cloudinary Service in an Android application. It was developed as an open source project so that you can explore the code for yourself and see how to improve your users' experience and the performance of your apps by delivering images, enhanced and optimized for different contexts. The demo app demonstrates how to leverage some of Cloudinary's capabilities, such as managing file uploads, displaying images responsively, and optimizing delivery through global Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).

In addition to showcasing some of Cloudinary's features, this app shows how to take advantage of existing open source libraries in combination with Google's latest Jetpack components, and get them to work together to create a functional app.
